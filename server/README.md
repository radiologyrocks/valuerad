# ValueRad Command Center — Backend

Stage 0 foundation: SMART-on-FHIR with a durable, encrypted, audited system of
record. See `../docs/STAGE_0_ARCHITECTURE.md` for the full blueprint.

## What's implemented

- **SMART App Launch** (Epic): PKCE launch → callback → token exchange.
- **Durable store** (`lib/store.js`): Postgres when `DATABASE_URL` is set,
  otherwise a **non-durable in-memory** store for local dev.
- **Encrypted tokens at rest** (`lib/crypto.js`, AES-256-GCM via `TOKEN_ENC_KEY`).
- **Append-only audit log**: every FHIR read and write is recorded.
- **FHIR write capability** (`lib/fhir.js`): `create` / `update`, plus a
  `SchedulingClient` seam for Stage 1 (Epic scheduling isn't plain FHIR write).
- **Automatic token refresh** before expiry.
- **RBAC scaffold** (`lib/rbac.js`) for ValueRad's own users (and, later, the agent).
- **Lead capture** (`POST /api/leads`) for the storefront form.
- **Async job table** seam (`jobs`) for Stage 2 prior-auth state machines.

## Run locally

```bash
cp .env.example .env      # fill in EPIC_* ; DATABASE_URL/TOKEN_ENC_KEY optional in dev
npm install
npm run dev               # http://localhost:3001
npm test                  # node:test unit tests
```

Without `DATABASE_URL`/`TOKEN_ENC_KEY` the server boots in dev mode (in-memory,
unencrypted) and **says so** at `/health`. In `NODE_ENV=production` it refuses to
start without both — you cannot accidentally handle PHI without a durable,
encrypted store.

| POST | `/api/features/request` | natural-language request → builder agent (503 without `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`) |
| POST | `/api/features/:id/approve` | tier 1 → active; tier 2 → canary, then → active |
| POST | `/api/features/:id/canary` | shadow-evaluate a tier-2 feature; stores the divergence/preview report |

| POST | `/api/features/revalidate` | re-run golden tests on all active features (upgrade gate) |

BI works two ways from the same metric engine (`domain/bi.js`): **CSV/JSON
extracts** (no integrations needed — upload RCM/RIS/payer-remit exports) and a
**durable warehouse** (`lib/warehouse.js`, Postgres or dev-memory). Datasets:
`claims`, `appointments`, `studies`, `slots`, `referrals`, `referrals_prior`.

## Stages implemented

Beyond Stage 0, the domain logic and agent for Stages 1–4 are implemented and
unit-tested (`domain/`, `agent/`). See `../docs/IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md` for the
blueprint→code map and what still needs live wiring (production Epic, payer
channels, a data warehouse, an Anthropic key + BAA).

The agent uses `claude-opus-4-8` with adaptive thinking and a manual,
guardrail-gated tool loop. It defaults to **recommend mode** (proposes, never
mutates) and graduates to **autonomous** per capability once trusted.

## Living software

Users request features in natural language; the **builder agent**
(`agent/builder.js`) composes a declarative definition (`domain/dsl.js` —
configuration for a trusted engine, never code), tests it against synthetic
golden fixtures (`domain/fixtures.js`), and registers it as **proposed**.
Activation is always a human decision; every lifecycle step is an audit row.
Tier 1 (reports/exports) is read-only over the warehouse; Tier 2 (payer
rule packs, ingest mappers) configures platform seams and must pass a
**canary** shadow-evaluation before promotion; Tier 3 (guardrails, FHIR
writes, crypto, RBAC, audit) is never generated. The builder's tools have no
code path to real data — generation runs outside the BAA boundary. See
`../docs/LIVING_SOFTWARE.md`.

### Agent auth: API key, or a Claude subscription for development

Both agents (operations runner and feature builder) support two transports,
with identical tools, guardrails, and audit:

- **`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` set** → Messages API (pay-per-token). Required in
  production.
- **No key, dev only** → fall back to the **Claude Agent SDK**
  (`agent/runnerDev.js`, `agent/builderDev.js`), which uses Claude Code's
  login. Run `claude /login` once with a Claude Pro/Max subscription and
  leave `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` unset (a set key overrides subscription auth).
  Agent SDK usage draws from the plan's monthly credit pool instead of
  per-token billing. Per Anthropic's terms this is for personal development
  only — `NODE_ENV=production` refuses the fallback.

On the subscription transport the guardrail plane is enforced *inside* every
tool handler (same `executeToolCall` as the production loop), so recommend
mode still never mutates and policy blocks still apply. Two extra gates:
the operations agent **refuses live EHR sessions** on this transport (no BAA
on a personal subscription — demo/synthetic data only), and the builder
never sees real data by construction. `AGENT_DEV_MODEL` / `BUILDER_DEV_MODEL`
optionally override the model.

## Production checklist (not in code)

- Host on a **HIPAA-eligible cloud with a signed BAA** — not GitHub Pages, not a
  generic VPS without a BAA.
- Set `DATABASE_URL`, `TOKEN_ENC_KEY`, `NODE_ENV=production`, real `EPIC_*`.
- Front with TLS; put secrets in a managed vault, not `.env`.
- Replace the dev-only header auth in `lib/rbac.js` with a real IdP.
